Basic lil Raspberry Pi camera stream code

    📷 Raspberry Pi captures live video using its camera module (v2)
    🖥️ A Python app (using FastAPI) processes the video stream in real-time
    🌐 The app serves the video as an MJPEG stream over HTTP
    🔒 A Cloudflare tunnel securely exposes this local stream to the internet (will include steps on how to do this)
    🌍 Anyone with the link can now view from anywhere (haven't published this)**

You should be able to run the app.py code as is on your R-Pi with a camera module, running via localhost (if not, then I'll include the version to do just that)
